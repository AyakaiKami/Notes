# Always understand the technology
### If you have a shell from a web server check the following types of files:
- config files
- database files (.db)
- hidden files (ls -la)

## Always try the exploit, if you think it's right, if the version is vulnerable try it, make your own script
- the server might be configured to undo your changes (so check if automating the exploitation works)

## Multiple vulnerabilities can be chained for example a stored XSS with a forced read 

## Can use errors to display text for example the contents of a file
